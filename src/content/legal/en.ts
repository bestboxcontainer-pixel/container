        heading: "How long does delivery take?",
        body: "Items in stock reach you within three to five working days with standard delivery, or within 24 to 48 hours with express delivery. For large appliances shipped by freight forwarder, the carrier contacts you in advance by phone to agree a delivery window. Items marked \"On request\" are ordered from the manufacturer and normally take two to four weeks.",
      },
      {
        heading: "How much does shipping cost?",
        body: "Standard delivery within Germany is free — with no minimum order value, whatever the size or weight of the goods. If you want delivery within 24 to 48 hours, express shipping costs a flat 70.00 euros. There are no other surcharges. The costs for your order are always shown in the shopping basket before you buy.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Do you ship outside Germany?",
        body: "As standard we deliver within Germany, including the islands. Deliveries to other European countries are possible by arrangement — write to us before ordering and we will check feasibility and costs for your address.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Will the appliance be carried into my home?",
        body: "Freight delivery ends at the kerbside by default. For 29.00 euros our carriers will bring the appliance to the desired installation location, including upper floors; unpacking and disposal of the transport packaging costs a further 9.00 euros. You cannot add these two services in the basket — call or email us and we will arrange them with the carrier. Please measure your stairwell, doorways and lift beforehand.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Do you offer connection and installation?",
        body: "Yes: 49 euros for a washing machine, tumble dryer or dishwasher, 39 euros for a free-standing refrigerator, 89 euros for installation in a prepared recess and 99 euros for wall-mounting a television. You arrange the service by telephone or email, ideally before ordering — it cannot be added in the basket. All connections must be present, freely accessible and compliant with standards. We are not permitted to work on your building's electrical installation.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Will you take my old appliance away?",
        body: "Yes, free of charge. When you buy a new appliance we collect one equivalent old appliance on delivery. Let us know in good time — by phone, by email or in the comments field of your order — so that the carrier can plan the collection. The old appliance should be disconnected, emptied, cleaned and freely accessible. Small waste appliances with no external dimension exceeding 25 centimetres are taken back even without a new purchase — up to three per equipment type. All other take-back options are set out on the \"Waste Electrical Equipment and Batteries\" page.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Which payment methods can I use?",
        body: "You can pay by advance bank transfer, by Sofortüberweisung, with PayPal, by credit card (Visa, Mastercard, American Express) or by SEPA direct debit. We do not charge extra fees for any of these methods (section 270a of the German Civil Code). With advance transfer we reserve the goods for seven calendar days; if payment has not arrived by then, we cancel the order. Which methods are available in your case is shown during checkout.",
      },
      {
        heading: "How does advance payment work?",
        body: "With the order confirmation you receive our bank details and the order number to quote as the payment reference; both also appear on the invoice attached to the confirmation as a PDF. We reserve the goods for seven calendar days and dispatch them within one to three working days of payment arriving. If payment does not reach us in time, we cancel the order and contact you.",
      },
      {
        heading: "How long is the warranty?",
        body: "All new appliances are covered by the statutory liability for defects for two years from delivery. If a fault occurs within the first twelve months, it is presumed to have existed from the outset — so you do not have to prove anything. Many manufacturers also grant voluntary guarantees, for example on motors or compressors.",
      },
      {
        heading: "What is the difference between a guarantee and statutory warranty rights?",
        body: "Statutory warranty rights are your legal rights against us and last two years. A guarantee is a voluntary manufacturer promise that may go further — ten years on a washing machine motor, for instance. A guarantee does not replace your statutory rights; it comes on top of them, and you decide which route to use.",
      },
      {
        heading: "How long do I have to return an item?",
        body: "There are two routes back. Your statutory right of withdrawal runs for 14 days from receipt of the goods and requires no reason; the binding text is the withdrawal policy. On top of that we voluntarily grant a contractual return right of 30 days from receipt, provided the item is unused, complete and fit for resale. This additional right does not restrict your statutory rights.",
      },
      {
        heading: "How do I send something back?",
        body: `Register the return in advance — by email to ${COMPANY.email} or by phone on ${COMPANY.phone}. The model withdrawal form is on our "Right of withdrawal" page, though you need not use it: an unequivocal statement is enough. For parcels you receive a free return label. Large appliances are collected from you by appointment; please disconnect and empty the appliance beforehand. Enclose all accessories and use the original box with its transport locks if you can.`,
      },
      {
        heading: "What does a return cost?",
        body: "Nothing. We bear the return costs — both for parcels and for the collection of large appliances by the freight forwarder.",
      },
      {
        heading: "When will I get my money back?",
        body: "We refund the purchase price no later than 14 days after receiving your withdrawal, once the goods have arrived with us or you have provided proof of dispatch. The refund is made using your original payment method and no fees apply. There are no outbound shipping costs to refund with standard delivery. If you chose express delivery, its surcharge stays with you under section 357(2) BGB: we refund only what the cheapest standard delivery would have cost — and that is free.",
      },
      {
        heading: "An item is marked \"On request\" — what does that mean?",
        body: "The item is not currently in stock but is available. We order it from the manufacturer once you place your order; delivery usually takes two to four weeks. You can order such items as normal and we will get back to you as soon as a firm date is confirmed.",
      },
      {
        heading: "How do I know whether a built-in appliance fits my kitchen?",
        body: "What matters are the recess dimensions in height, width and depth and the position of the connections. All appliance and recess dimensions are listed in the technical data on the product page. If in doubt, measure again or call us — our advisers will check the fit with you and suggest alternatives.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Where do I find an appliance's energy efficiency class?",
        body: "Every product page shows the EU energy label with the efficiency class as well as the official product information sheet. It also lists consumption figures, noise emissions and — for washing machines and dishwashers — water consumption per programme. When comparing, always make sure the programme and load settings are the same.",
      },
      {
        heading: "What do I need to know before buying a drone?",
        body: "The EU drone regulation applies in Germany. As a remote pilot you must register with the Federal Aviation Office (Luftfahrt-Bundesamt) and receive an electronic registration number (e-ID) that you must attach visibly to the drone. Third-party liability insurance is also a legal requirement under section 43 of the German Aviation Act — even for very light models. In the open category you may fly up to 120 metres, always within visual line of sight and never over crowds; no-fly zones such as airports, hospitals, federal motorways and nature reserves are off limits.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Do I need a drone licence for a drone under 250 grams?",
        body: "No. For drones under 250 grams or in class C0 neither the EU A1/A3 proof of competency nor the A2 remote pilot certificate is required. Registration and insurance are still mandatory as soon as the drone has a sensor capable of capturing personal data — which applies to virtually all camera models. Filming over private property also remains limited by personality rights and data protection law.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Can I order as a business and receive a VAT invoice?",
        body: "Yes. Enter your company name in the \"Company\" field during the order process. The invoice is attached to your order confirmation as a PDF and shows the VAT included. If you need your VAT identification number on the invoice, please add it to the comments field of your order or send it to us afterwards — there is no dedicated field for it in the order process yet. Please note two differences from consumer purchases: businesses have no statutory right of withdrawal, and the limitation period for defect claims on new goods is one year from the passing of risk rather than two. Our voluntary 30-day return right does apply to you as well.",
      },
      {
        heading: "What if an appliance fails after the two years are up?",
        body: "Contact us anyway. A manufacturer guarantee often still covers individual components, or a repair works out considerably cheaper than a new purchase. We will put you in touch with an authorised service partner and check spare part availability for your model.",
